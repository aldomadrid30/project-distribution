This is a project about the numbers and types of crimes that were committed in the United States during the year 2015. 

The author of this project gives a good description of the data that he aquired. However, his graphs were not too clear. 
Larger graphs would have been better. The author gives an adequate comparison of the data. 

I would give this project a 3 out of 4 or a B.
